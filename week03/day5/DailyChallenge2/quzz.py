What is a class?
————————————————
Class is a blueprint to define an object in Python.
It's a datatype, that includes both variables and methods to operate on the data.
In Python, it is defined using the 'class' keyword.


What is an instance?
————————————————————
An instance of a Class is an object created based on the class as a template.
When an instance is created, a copy of the blueprint is created and referenced in the variable chosen.


What is encapsulation?
——————————————————————
Encapsulation is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
It represents the concept of combining data and methods within a single unit (such as an object).


What is abstraction?
————————————————————
Abstraction is also one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
It defines an attempt to represent complex objects and structures in a simplified and abstract manner,
which makes the code flexible and scalable.


What is inheritance?
————————————————————
Inheritance is also one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
It is a concept that allows classes to inherit methods and data from another class (or classes).


What is multiple inheritance?
—————————————————————————————
Multiple inheritance means that a class can have more than one ancestor.
In this case, the class inherits methods from all the ancestors provided using a proper priority order.


What is polymorphism?
————————————————————
Polymorphism is the fourth code principle of Object-Oriented Programming.
This principle is implemented via the inheritance concept and allows objects to take multiple forms
by methods of overriding and overloading.


What is method resolution order or MRO?
———————————————————————————————————————
MRO is the exact way how Python decides which methods to run according to the inheritance hierarchy.
To search for a proper method, a depth-first search algorithm is used, so that the search runs based
on the ancestors' definition order without searching the same class twice.
Using ClassName.mro() it's possible to test the actual order of the ancestors.
