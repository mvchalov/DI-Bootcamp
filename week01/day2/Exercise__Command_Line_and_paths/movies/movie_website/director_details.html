        <h1>Tim Burton</h1>
        <img src="../burton.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Tim Burton, director and artist, is widely regarded as one of cinema’s most imaginative and visual filmmakers. Burton grew up in Burbank, California and attended the newly opened California Institute of the Arts (CalArts).  As one of the earliest students of the famed Character Animation Program, his work attracted the attention of Walt Disney Productions and gained him an apprenticeship at the studio. </p>
        <p>In 1982, while there, he directed his first short, Vincent, a 6-minute black-and-white stop motion film based on a poem by Burton and narrated by his hero, Vincent Price.  During his time with Disney, he also directed the 1983 kung fu–inspired short film adaptation of Hansel and Gretel, and the 1984 live-action short film Frankenweenie, which would later be remade as a feature-length stop motion film in 2012.  </p>
